/*! An erased-mutable status code suitably large for all the system codes
which can be returned on this system.

For Windows, these might be:

    - `com_code` (`HRESULT`)  [you need to include "com_code.hpp" explicitly for this]
    - `nt_code` (`LONG`)
    - `win32_code` (`DWORD`)

For POSIX, `posix_code` is possible.

You are guaranteed that `system_code` can be transported by the compiler
in exactly two CPU registers.
