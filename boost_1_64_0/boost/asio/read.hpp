 *
 * @param handler The handler to be called when the read operation completes.
 * Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the
 * handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   const boost::system::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
 *
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes copied into the
 *                                           // buffers. If an error occurred,
 *                                           // this will be the  number of
 *                                           // bytes successfully transferred
 *                                           // prior to the error.
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. On
 * immediate completion, invocation of the handler will be performed in a
 * manner equivalent to using boost::asio::post().
